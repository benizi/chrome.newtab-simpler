# Chrome Simpler New Tab

Super simple new tab extension.

# Intro

I used to use New Tab Redirect, but then I realized I just wanted a blank
screen, but dark (so it doesn't flash at conferences).

# Features

- [x] Launches blank screen in new tab.
- [ ] Add setting to optionally redirect to a "homepage".
